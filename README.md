Great day Logiks Users :-)

Ever faced with a situation when, you have code or a design that you need to test quickly and possibly share with others. Logiks Play is a playground for an interactive coding environment for Logiks to test Logiks,PHP,JS,CSS,Smarty,etc. right inside your browser.

Use Logiks Play to learn and explore Logiks, prototype parts of your app, and create learning environments for others.

Logiks Play lets you workout your algorithms, explore system APIs, etc in an interactive way without going through the bunch of installing Logiks and creating a workspace.

A quick tour of Logiks Play will give you a better understanding of what it is and its potential.

You can also share your code snippets, add comments and display results. Great way to teach and explore Logiks Enviroment by relating concepts with code.

That evaluates each statement and displays results as updates are made, without the need to create a project.
